Examples
========

We have included many examples of common tasks, these are a good place to start with writing your own code for problems or to clarify something which is not clear in the documentation.
The examples can be viewed online in the github `repository`_.
They can also be downloaded and run locally on your own computer, however this will also require that jupyter is installed.

If you have followed the installation instructions you can install jupyter using pip:

    python -m pip install jupyter

you can then run jupyter:

    jupyter notebook

This will open a notebook page in your browser, you can use this to open and run the example files from github
