=============================
Examples showing common tasks
=============================

In this repo we have tried to provide examples showing how to use the main features of slippy.

These are available as jupyter notbooks, these allow code and explanitory text to be mixed and are much easier to read
than pure code examples. In order to run them you must install jupyter in the same virtual environment as slippy is
installed in.

If you have followed the installation instructions you can do this by typing the following into your anaconda prompt:
>> activate slippy
>> conda install jupyter -y
>> jupyter notebook

The last command will open your default notebooks folder, navigate to this package and open the example which you want.

Examples in the forlder are:
